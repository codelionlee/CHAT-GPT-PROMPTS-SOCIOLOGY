Good day chat. i have an introduction that i want you to format and edit. correct gramma and sentence structure. "Social capital, a valuable form of symbolic power, encompasses the social connections, trust, and norms that exist within a community or society (Siisiainen, 2000). It influences individuals and communities, shaping their access to resources, opportunities, and support networks. However, the impact of income inequality and social media algorithms on social capital can be significant and requires attention.  

Social capital is a form of symbolic power that is highly affected by several factors including income inequality and algorithms underlying social media. Symbolic capital ‘prestige honor’ is according to Bourdieu in Heath et el (2018) “a reputation for competence and an image of respectability and honorability”. Symbolic capital exists only in the eyes of others and is named by Bourdieu in ‘social classes’ as ‘fields’ (Siisiainen, 2000).  Fields are ‘systems of relations independent of the populations defined by those relations’ Any form of capital can be turned into social capital, it is insight that fields play a major role in distributing social capital amongst and between classes (Hilgas et el., 2014) 

Social media algorithms play a crucial role in shaping social capital. These algorithms, designed to maximize user engagement, often prioritize content that aligns with users' existing beliefs and preferences (Vitak et el., 2011). 

Implementing rules, regulations and policies that reduce economic unfairness and promote equal opportunities both on social media and income distribution (employment), can enhance social capital across society. Enforcing social media algorithmic transparency on social promotes responsibility hypes trust among social agents (Mohseni et el., 2018). 

 

This essay aims to outline the relationships and further explain the impacts of income inequality and social media algorithms to social capital as identified by Robert Putnam, Pierre Bourdieu and Francis Fukuyama. Robert Putnam believes, Pierre Bourdieu believes social capital is linked to social structures(quality of networks), distribution of power, distribution of resources. Fukuyama believes social capital is linked to levels of trust and social norms (Siisiainen, 2000). 

The essay will further explain how income inequality links to class creation and how social capital is affected by social media usage, and algorithms created as a result of this usage as described by Putnam, Bourdieu and Fukuyama. Some of the views, opinions and similarities will also be analyzed in order to identify the impact that all these factors have as well as point out potential solutions to the threats that exist.  

In this essay ideas are presented as follows: Income inequality is presented and its links class creation. Social capital is then explored linking social media, algorithms underpinning them and an introduction to general views of Putnam, Bourdieu and Fukuyama's perspectives around social media. Views of social capital from Putnam, Bourdieu and Fukuyama's are further discussed extensively and analyzed for similarities. Impacts of income inequality on social capital are discussed. Before the conclusion, impacts of social media algorithms are discussed based on LinkedIn, Facebook and tweeter networks and possible solutions proposed.  "

Social capital, which encompasses social connections, trust, and norms within a community or society (Siisiainen, 2000), is a valuable form of symbolic power. It plays a crucial role in influencing individuals and communities by shaping their access to resources, opportunities, and support networks. However, income inequality and social media algorithms can have a significant impact on social capital, necessitating attention.

According to Bourdieu, symbolic capital refers to "a reputation for competence and an image of respectability and honorability" (Heath et al., 2018). Symbolic capital exists only in the perception of others and is categorized by Bourdieu as "fields" within social classes (Siisiainen, 2000). Fields represent systems of relations that are independent of the populations defined by those relations. Any form of capital can be transformed into social capital, but it is essential to recognize that fields play a major role in distributing social capital among and between classes (Hilgas et al., 2014).

Social media algorithms significantly shape social capital. These algorithms, designed to maximize user engagement, often prioritize content that aligns with users' existing beliefs and preferences (Vitak et al., 2011).

To enhance social capital across society, it is crucial to implement rules, regulations, and policies that reduce economic unfairness and promote equal opportunities, both on social media and in income distribution (employment). Enforcing social media algorithmic transparency promotes responsibility and fosters trust among social agents (Mohseni et al., 2018).

The objective of this essay is to outline the relationships and elaborate on the impacts of income inequality and social media algorithms on social capital, as identified by Robert Putnam, Pierre Bourdieu, and Francis Fukuyama. Robert Putnam associates social capital with social structures, the quality of networks, the distribution of power, and the distribution of resources. Pierre Bourdieu believes social capital is linked to social structures, while Francis Fukuyama associates it with levels of trust and social norms (Siisiainen, 2000).

Furthermore, this essay will explore how income inequality relates to the creation of social classes and how social capital is affected by social media usage and the algorithms that result from it, as described by Putnam, Bourdieu, and Fukuyama. It will analyze various views, opinions, and similarities to identify the impacts of these factors and propose potential solutions to the challenges they present.

The essay presents ideas in the following structure: it begins by presenting income inequality and its connection to class creation. It then explores social capital, linking it to social media and the algorithms underlying it, while providing an introduction to the general perspectives of Putnam, Bourdieu, and Fukuyama on social capital. The views of social capital from these three theorists are extensively discussed and analyzed for similarities. The essay also examines the impacts of income inequality on social capital. Finally, the essay discusses the effects of social media algorithms based on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter networks, and proposes potential solutions before reaching a conclusion.

can you now edit my essay background information and reduce redundancy. do not change the meaning of the paragraphs also keep my refferences. make sure each paragraph has a paragraph sentence "Gender, race, ethnicity and educational background are some of the factors considered to have direct impacts on employment (Redmiles 2018), a major source of income. Inequality is ‘the unfair difference between groups of people in society, when some have more wealth, status or opportunities than others’ according to oxford dictionary (Oxford 2023). In the same context income inequality is the unfair distribution of income between groups or individuals. Income inequality can be measured in various ways, and one is using the ‘Robinhood index’, which considers people’s household incomes. The degree of income inequality is directly linked to class division leading to upper, middle and lower classes. 

Income inequality introduces poverty which directly relates to mortality rates (Cartell V 2001). Contrary to Kawachi et el’s views in Cartell V, (2001), Cartell V (2001) argues that as a result of differences in social opinion and stance, trust is diluted between groups of hierarchal incomes.  

Social capital can be categorized into online and offline. Online capital is built by online presence and interacts effectively depending on platform of choice (Cartell V 2001). Facebook and LinkedIn are of interest in this study as they are commonly used across the globe. The study of algorithms underpinning social media is of vital importance as these have further and direct effect of social capital rather than just the platform itself. Algorithms are set to personalize information creating echo chambers and bubbles (Vitak et al., 2011).  

The use of social media algorithms has impacts on social capital directly if they can impact on fields, networks and trust all basis of Fukuyama, Putnam and Bourdieu (Yi Mou and Carolyne A Lin, 2017) online social capital could improve or negatively affect trust. Online maintained social capital is highlighted to be of utmost importance as it directly facts other forms of capital. Great examples of online maintained social capital are previous trainees linking online or educators as well as students (Yi Mou and Caroline A Lin, 2017).  

Trust, community shared normal behaviors, expectations (shared norms) and networks between individuals are 3 fundamental foundations to social capital and a measure according to Putnam's study. According to Putnam, social capital is further defined and measured based on historical identities that segregate communities indefinitely. Connections created between people, especially those that engage willingly and voluntarily, are also found to be a good source of social capital in Putnam's context. Putnam further argues that a high level of social capital can institute a healthy and functional economic system. Connections reduce the cost of living if positively utilized for mutual benefits, thus social capital. Shared norms create a society that is accountable and hence eradicating crime and corruption enhancing trust within the community Siisiainen (2000). 

According to Putnam in (Siisiainen, 2000), as much as all networks are important towards social capital, the most important to social capital are voluntary relations. Voluntary relations create a society with no hierarchy, hence increasing trust. Despite that mentioned networks create productive connections to the broader community, Siisiainen (2000) believes that it is not sufficient for Putnam to focus associations on sport, leisure, cultural (Siisiainen, 2000).  

Healthy social circles are seen with increased trust and community accountability. Putnam in (Vitak et el., 2011) call it ‘reciprocity’ (doing to others what you would like to be done towards you). Different interests spark problems around trust and the quality of associations, some merely create distrust between members of such groups. Trust and healthy circles in a society promote a successful government according to Putnam (Siisiainen, 2000).  

Putnam’s does not deal with politics and conflict. In Putnam’s work there is little to no views around politics, conflicting groups and networks and social capital from his study. His arguments in (Siisiainen, 2000) do not touch on distrust and its effects on social capital directly. 

Bourdieu joined the social capital study to enhance and fill up the gaps in Putnam’s study of social capital. If universal values are respected, then we can trust. Bourdieu bases his argument on the concept of fields, ‘habitus’, social structure, distribution of power and resources and that doesn’t exclude educational and cultural institutions as a form of power and hence social capital (Siisiainen, 2000). 

“....economic capital, which is immediately convertible into money and may be institutionalized in the form of property rights; as cultural capital, which is convertible, on certain conditions, into economic capital and may be institutionalized in the form of educational qualifications; and as social capital, made up of social obligations (,connections'), which is convertible, in certain conditions, into economic capital and may be institutionalized in the form of a title of nobility" ([1986:243]). 

Cultural capital, a direct effect or a major contributing factor to social capital, is accumulated by an individual belonging to a society from childhood. Bourdieu’s perspective is based on universal interest and linked to class ideas that he further defines to be economic, cultural and social capital. This becomes fairly comparable and closely equivalent symbolic capital in his analysis. Bourdieu elaborates that power is an underlying structure from a broader point of view (Siisiainen, 2000).  

In his study Bourdieu’s never had arguing points with Putnam on social capital ideas, symbolic power, trust and associations. Bourdieu’s perspective does not explicitly deal with trust which is seen as a threat to symbolic capital and comparable to social capital in his study (Siisiainen, 2000). Similar to Putnam Bourdieu measures social capital based on connections and how effectively one can engage with them apart from trust. Bourdieu emphasizes that creating and maintaining as well as improving social capital directly has a positive impact on all other forms of capital that exist (Siisiainen, 2000). 

In his study, Fukuyama (1995) neither disagrees with Bourdieu nor Putnam. Fukuyama rather emphasizes Putnam’s findings on the importance of connections, trust and societal norms. Fukuyama argues that any human ‘endeavor’ cannot fail if there is large enough social capital around it (Siisiainen, 2000).  He goes on to elaborate how public shared systems are trust dependent. Fukuyama emphasizes more on the degree of trust rather than just trust itself and extends his study to point out how trust and social norms affect variables in a society. Fukuyama identifies trust, a means of social capital to be affecting economic stability and development as well as politics of a society. Quality of trust is explored in Putnam explanations on ‘bridging’ and ‘bonding’ networks to constitute different degrees of trust (Crow 2002). 

Trust between social agents, according to Fukuyama (1995) invokes a drastic reduction to transitional costs and fostering of policies. The most valuable form of network is connections between strangers. This form of connection is largely disturbed by family relationships, cultures and fields. It should be noted that linking with strangers comes with an expense of trust (Fukuyama,1995). In his study of peasant villagers in Italy, Edward Banfield in Francis (1995) elaborates family ties (kinship) to be insufficient for growth and development of a tangible and viable social income. In agreement Putnam’s view on social capital mentions bridging networks and social capital to be more valuable to economic and social development compared to bonding networks and capitals (Fukuyama,1995).

Gender, race, ethnicity, and educational background are factors that directly impact employment (Redmiles 2018), which is a major source of income. Inequality, defined as the unfair difference in wealth, status, or opportunities among different groups of people (Oxford 2023), manifests as income inequality—the unjust distribution of income between individuals or groups. Income inequality can be measured using various methods, such as the Robinhood index, which takes into account household incomes. The degree of income inequality is closely tied to class division, resulting in the formation of upper, middle, and lower classes.

Income inequality gives rise to poverty, which in turn affects mortality rates (Cartell V 2001). While Kawachi et al. in Cartell V (2001) argue that differences in social opinion and stance dilute trust between hierarchical income groups, Cartell V (2001) contends that inequality erodes trust.

Social capital can be categorized as online or offline. Online social capital is built through effective interactions and presence on platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn, which have global usage (Cartell V 2001). The study of social media algorithms is crucial, as these algorithms personalize information and create echo chambers and filter bubbles (Vitak et al., 2011).

The use of social media algorithms directly impacts social capital by influencing fields, networks, and trust—the foundations of social capital according to Fukuyama, Putnam, and Bourdieu (Yi Mou and Carolyne A Lin, 2017). Online maintained social capital, exemplified by connections among trainees, educators, and students (Yi Mou and Caroline A Lin, 2017), holds significant importance as it directly affects other forms of capital.

Trust, shared norms, and networks between individuals are the fundamental foundations of social capital, as measured by Putnam (Siisiainen 2000). Putnam argues that social capital is shaped by historical identities that perpetuate community segregation. Connections, especially voluntary and willing engagements, contribute to social capital and establish a healthy and functional economic system. Additionally, shared norms create a society that promotes accountability, thus reducing crime and corruption and enhancing trust within the community (Siisiainen 2000).

While all networks are important for social capital, voluntary relations hold the most significance, according to Putnam (Siisiainen 2000). Voluntary relations foster trust and create a society without hierarchies. However, Siisiainen (2000) believes that focusing solely on associations related to sports, leisure, and culture is inadequate.

Healthy social circles characterized by trust and community accountability contribute to successful governance, as stated by Putnam (Siisiainen 2000). Putnam's work, however, lacks discussions on politics, conflicting groups, networks, and their direct impact on social capital. Distrust and its effects on social capital are not explicitly addressed by Putnam (Siisiainen 2000).

Bourdieu's study complements Putnam's work on social capital by expanding on the concept of fields, habitus, social structure, and the distribution of power and resources, which include educational and cultural institutions as forms of power and social capital (Siisiainen 2000). Bourdieu defines economic, cultural, and social capital as closely related to class and symbolic capital. Power serves as an underlying structure in Bourdieu's analysis (Siisiainen 2000).

Bourdieu's study does not directly oppose Putnam's ideas on social capital, symbolic power, trust, and associations. Trust, as a threat to symbolic capital and comparable to social capital in Bourdieu's study, is not explicitly discussed (Siisiainen 2000). Like Putnam, Bourdieu measures social capital based on connections and their effective utilization but emphasizes that

Bourdieu emphasizes that creating, maintaining, and improving social capital directly impacts all other forms of capital that exist (Siisiainen, 2000). His perspective provides a more comprehensive understanding of social capital by incorporating the dynamics of power, resources, and cultural institutions. However, Bourdieu's study does not explicitly delve into the role of trust and its effects on social capital, unlike Putnam's focus on bridging and bonding networks and their varying degrees of trust (Crow 2002).

In his study, Fukuyama (1995) does not present arguments against Bourdieu or Putnam but rather underscores the significance of connections, trust, and societal norms as highlighted by Putnam. Fukuyama asserts that any human endeavor can succeed when there is a sufficient amount of social capital present (Siisiainen, 2000). He further examines how trust and social norms impact various aspects of society, including economic stability, development, and political dynamics. Putnam's concept of "bridging" and "bonding" networks, constituting different degrees of trust (Crow 2002), helps explore the quality of trust in Fukuyama's analysis.

According to Fukuyama (1995), trust between social agents significantly reduces transactional costs and fosters the development of policies. The most valuable form of network consists of connections between strangers, which is often hindered by family relationships, cultural factors, and different fields. Fukuyama stresses that establishing trust with strangers comes at the expense of trust in other areas (Fukuyama,1995). In Francis's study on peasant villagers in Italy, Edward Banfield explains that family ties alone are insufficient for tangible and viable social progress. This aligns with Putnam's perspective that bridging networks and social capital are more beneficial for economic and social development compared to bonding networks and capitals (Fukuyama,1995).
