Good day chat. i have an introduction that i want you to format and edit. correct gramma and sentence structure. "Social capital, a valuable form of symbolic power, encompasses the social connections, trust, and norms that exist within a community or society (Siisiainen, 2000). It influences individuals and communities, shaping their access to resources, opportunities, and support networks. However, the impact of income inequality and social media algorithms on social capital can be significant and requires attention.  

Social capital is a form of symbolic power that is highly affected by several factors including income inequality and algorithms underlying social media. Symbolic capital ‘prestige honor’ is according to Bourdieu in Heath et el (2018) “a reputation for competence and an image of respectability and honorability”. Symbolic capital exists only in the eyes of others and is named by Bourdieu in ‘social classes’ as ‘fields’ (Siisiainen, 2000).  Fields are ‘systems of relations independent of the populations defined by those relations’ Any form of capital can be turned into social capital, it is insight that fields play a major role in distributing social capital amongst and between classes (Hilgas et el., 2014) 

Social media algorithms play a crucial role in shaping social capital. These algorithms, designed to maximize user engagement, often prioritize content that aligns with users' existing beliefs and preferences (Vitak et el., 2011). 

Implementing rules, regulations and policies that reduce economic unfairness and promote equal opportunities both on social media and income distribution (employment), can enhance social capital across society. Enforcing social media algorithmic transparency on social promotes responsibility hypes trust among social agents (Mohseni et el., 2018). 

 

This essay aims to outline the relationships and further explain the impacts of income inequality and social media algorithms to social capital as identified by Robert Putnam, Pierre Bourdieu and Francis Fukuyama. Robert Putnam believes, Pierre Bourdieu believes social capital is linked to social structures(quality of networks), distribution of power, distribution of resources. Fukuyama believes social capital is linked to levels of trust and social norms (Siisiainen, 2000). 

The essay will further explain how income inequality links to class creation and how social capital is affected by social media usage, and algorithms created as a result of this usage as described by Putnam, Bourdieu and Fukuyama. Some of the views, opinions and similarities will also be analyzed in order to identify the impact that all these factors have as well as point out potential solutions to the threats that exist.  

In this essay ideas are presented as follows: Income inequality is presented and its links class creation. Social capital is then explored linking social media, algorithms underpinning them and an introduction to general views of Putnam, Bourdieu and Fukuyama's perspectives around social media. Views of social capital from Putnam, Bourdieu and Fukuyama's are further discussed extensively and analyzed for similarities. Impacts of income inequality on social capital are discussed. Before the conclusion, impacts of social media algorithms are discussed based on LinkedIn, Facebook and tweeter networks and possible solutions proposed.  "

Social capital, which encompasses social connections, trust, and norms within a community or society (Siisiainen, 2000), is a valuable form of symbolic power. It plays a crucial role in influencing individuals and communities by shaping their access to resources, opportunities, and support networks. However, income inequality and social media algorithms can have a significant impact on social capital, necessitating attention.

According to Bourdieu, symbolic capital refers to "a reputation for competence and an image of respectability and honorability" (Heath et al., 2018). Symbolic capital exists only in the perception of others and is categorized by Bourdieu as "fields" within social classes (Siisiainen, 2000). Fields represent systems of relations that are independent of the populations defined by those relations. Any form of capital can be transformed into social capital, but it is essential to recognize that fields play a major role in distributing social capital among and between classes (Hilgas et al., 2014).

Social media algorithms significantly shape social capital. These algorithms, designed to maximize user engagement, often prioritize content that aligns with users' existing beliefs and preferences (Vitak et al., 2011).

To enhance social capital across society, it is crucial to implement rules, regulations, and policies that reduce economic unfairness and promote equal opportunities, both on social media and in income distribution (employment). Enforcing social media algorithmic transparency promotes responsibility and fosters trust among social agents (Mohseni et al., 2018).

The objective of this essay is to outline the relationships and elaborate on the impacts of income inequality and social media algorithms on social capital, as identified by Robert Putnam, Pierre Bourdieu, and Francis Fukuyama. Robert Putnam associates social capital with social structures, the quality of networks, the distribution of power, and the distribution of resources. Pierre Bourdieu believes social capital is linked to social structures, while Francis Fukuyama associates it with levels of trust and social norms (Siisiainen, 2000).

Furthermore, this essay will explore how income inequality relates to the creation of social classes and how social capital is affected by social media usage and the algorithms that result from it, as described by Putnam, Bourdieu, and Fukuyama. It will analyze various views, opinions, and similarities to identify the impacts of these factors and propose potential solutions to the challenges they present.

The essay presents ideas in the following structure: it begins by presenting income inequality and its connection to class creation. It then explores social capital, linking it to social media and the algorithms underlying it, while providing an introduction to the general perspectives of Putnam, Bourdieu, and Fukuyama on social capital. The views of social capital from these three theorists are extensively discussed and analyzed for similarities. The essay also examines the impacts of income inequality on social capital. Finally, the essay discusses the effects of social media algorithms based on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter networks, and proposes potential solutions before reaching a conclusion.

can you now edit my essay background information and reduce redundancy. do not change the meaning of the paragraphs also keep my refferences. make sure each paragraph has a paragraph sentence "Gender, race, ethnicity and educational background are some of the factors considered to have direct impacts on employment (Redmiles 2018), a major source of income. Inequality is ‘the unfair difference between groups of people in society, when some have more wealth, status or opportunities than others’ according to oxford dictionary (Oxford 2023). In the same context income inequality is the unfair distribution of income between groups or individuals. Income inequality can be measured in various ways, and one is using the ‘Robinhood index’, which considers people’s household incomes. The degree of income inequality is directly linked to class division leading to upper, middle and lower classes. 

Income inequality introduces poverty which directly relates to mortality rates (Cartell V 2001). Contrary to Kawachi et el’s views in Cartell V, (2001), Cartell V (2001) argues that as a result of differences in social opinion and stance, trust is diluted between groups of hierarchal incomes.  

Social capital can be categorized into online and offline. Online capital is built by online presence and interacts effectively depending on platform of choice (Cartell V 2001). Facebook and LinkedIn are of interest in this study as they are commonly used across the globe. The study of algorithms underpinning social media is of vital importance as these have further and direct effect of social capital rather than just the platform itself. Algorithms are set to personalize information creating echo chambers and bubbles (Vitak et al., 2011).  

The use of social media algorithms has impacts on social capital directly if they can impact on fields, networks and trust all basis of Fukuyama, Putnam and Bourdieu (Yi Mou and Carolyne A Lin, 2017) online social capital could improve or negatively affect trust. Online maintained social capital is highlighted to be of utmost importance as it directly facts other forms of capital. Great examples of online maintained social capital are previous trainees linking online or educators as well as students (Yi Mou and Caroline A Lin, 2017).  

Trust, community shared normal behaviors, expectations (shared norms) and networks between individuals are 3 fundamental foundations to social capital and a measure according to Putnam's study. According to Putnam, social capital is further defined and measured based on historical identities that segregate communities indefinitely. Connections created between people, especially those that engage willingly and voluntarily, are also found to be a good source of social capital in Putnam's context. Putnam further argues that a high level of social capital can institute a healthy and functional economic system. Connections reduce the cost of living if positively utilized for mutual benefits, thus social capital. Shared norms create a society that is accountable and hence eradicating crime and corruption enhancing trust within the community Siisiainen (2000). 

According to Putnam in (Siisiainen, 2000), as much as all networks are important towards social capital, the most important to social capital are voluntary relations. Voluntary relations create a society with no hierarchy, hence increasing trust. Despite that mentioned networks create productive connections to the broader community, Siisiainen (2000) believes that it is not sufficient for Putnam to focus associations on sport, leisure, cultural (Siisiainen, 2000).  

Healthy social circles are seen with increased trust and community accountability. Putnam in (Vitak et el., 2011) call it ‘reciprocity’ (doing to others what you would like to be done towards you). Different interests spark problems around trust and the quality of associations, some merely create distrust between members of such groups. Trust and healthy circles in a society promote a successful government according to Putnam (Siisiainen, 2000).  

Putnam’s does not deal with politics and conflict. In Putnam’s work there is little to no views around politics, conflicting groups and networks and social capital from his study. His arguments in (Siisiainen, 2000) do not touch on distrust and its effects on social capital directly. 

Bourdieu joined the social capital study to enhance and fill up the gaps in Putnam’s study of social capital. If universal values are respected, then we can trust. Bourdieu bases his argument on the concept of fields, ‘habitus’, social structure, distribution of power and resources and that doesn’t exclude educational and cultural institutions as a form of power and hence social capital (Siisiainen, 2000). 

“....economic capital, which is immediately convertible into money and may be institutionalized in the form of property rights; as cultural capital, which is convertible, on certain conditions, into economic capital and may be institutionalized in the form of educational qualifications; and as social capital, made up of social obligations (,connections'), which is convertible, in certain conditions, into economic capital and may be institutionalized in the form of a title of nobility" ([1986:243]). 

Cultural capital, a direct effect or a major contributing factor to social capital, is accumulated by an individual belonging to a society from childhood. Bourdieu’s perspective is based on universal interest and linked to class ideas that he further defines to be economic, cultural and social capital. This becomes fairly comparable and closely equivalent symbolic capital in his analysis. Bourdieu elaborates that power is an underlying structure from a broader point of view (Siisiainen, 2000).  

In his study Bourdieu’s never had arguing points with Putnam on social capital ideas, symbolic power, trust and associations. Bourdieu’s perspective does not explicitly deal with trust which is seen as a threat to symbolic capital and comparable to social capital in his study (Siisiainen, 2000). Similar to Putnam Bourdieu measures social capital based on connections and how effectively one can engage with them apart from trust. Bourdieu emphasizes that creating and maintaining as well as improving social capital directly has a positive impact on all other forms of capital that exist (Siisiainen, 2000). 

In his study, Fukuyama (1995) neither disagrees with Bourdieu nor Putnam. Fukuyama rather emphasizes Putnam’s findings on the importance of connections, trust and societal norms. Fukuyama argues that any human ‘endeavor’ cannot fail if there is large enough social capital around it (Siisiainen, 2000).  He goes on to elaborate how public shared systems are trust dependent. Fukuyama emphasizes more on the degree of trust rather than just trust itself and extends his study to point out how trust and social norms affect variables in a society. Fukuyama identifies trust, a means of social capital to be affecting economic stability and development as well as politics of a society. Quality of trust is explored in Putnam explanations on ‘bridging’ and ‘bonding’ networks to constitute different degrees of trust (Crow 2002). 

Trust between social agents, according to Fukuyama (1995) invokes a drastic reduction to transitional costs and fostering of policies. The most valuable form of network is connections between strangers. This form of connection is largely disturbed by family relationships, cultures and fields. It should be noted that linking with strangers comes with an expense of trust (Fukuyama,1995). In his study of peasant villagers in Italy, Edward Banfield in Francis (1995) elaborates family ties (kinship) to be insufficient for growth and development of a tangible and viable social income. In agreement Putnam’s view on social capital mentions bridging networks and social capital to be more valuable to economic and social development compared to bonding networks and capitals (Fukuyama,1995).

Gender, race, ethnicity, and educational background are factors that directly impact employment (Redmiles 2018), which is a major source of income. Inequality, defined as the unfair difference in wealth, status, or opportunities among different groups of people (Oxford 2023), manifests as income inequality—the unjust distribution of income between individuals or groups. Income inequality can be measured using various methods, such as the Robinhood index, which takes into account household incomes. The degree of income inequality is closely tied to class division, resulting in the formation of upper, middle, and lower classes.

Income inequality gives rise to poverty, which in turn affects mortality rates (Cartell V 2001). While Kawachi et al. in Cartell V (2001) argue that differences in social opinion and stance dilute trust between hierarchical income groups, Cartell V (2001) contends that inequality erodes trust.

Social capital can be categorized as online or offline. Online social capital is built through effective interactions and presence on platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn, which have global usage (Cartell V 2001). The study of social media algorithms is crucial, as these algorithms personalize information and create echo chambers and filter bubbles (Vitak et al., 2011).

The use of social media algorithms directly impacts social capital by influencing fields, networks, and trust—the foundations of social capital according to Fukuyama, Putnam, and Bourdieu (Yi Mou and Carolyne A Lin, 2017). Online maintained social capital, exemplified by connections among trainees, educators, and students (Yi Mou and Caroline A Lin, 2017), holds significant importance as it directly affects other forms of capital.

Trust, shared norms, and networks between individuals are the fundamental foundations of social capital, as measured by Putnam (Siisiainen 2000). Putnam argues that social capital is shaped by historical identities that perpetuate community segregation. Connections, especially voluntary and willing engagements, contribute to social capital and establish a healthy and functional economic system. Additionally, shared norms create a society that promotes accountability, thus reducing crime and corruption and enhancing trust within the community (Siisiainen 2000).

While all networks are important for social capital, voluntary relations hold the most significance, according to Putnam (Siisiainen 2000). Voluntary relations foster trust and create a society without hierarchies. However, Siisiainen (2000) believes that focusing solely on associations related to sports, leisure, and culture is inadequate.

Healthy social circles characterized by trust and community accountability contribute to successful governance, as stated by Putnam (Siisiainen 2000). Putnam's work, however, lacks discussions on politics, conflicting groups, networks, and their direct impact on social capital. Distrust and its effects on social capital are not explicitly addressed by Putnam (Siisiainen 2000).

Bourdieu's study complements Putnam's work on social capital by expanding on the concept of fields, habitus, social structure, and the distribution of power and resources, which include educational and cultural institutions as forms of power and social capital (Siisiainen 2000). Bourdieu defines economic, cultural, and social capital as closely related to class and symbolic capital. Power serves as an underlying structure in Bourdieu's analysis (Siisiainen 2000).

Bourdieu's study does not directly oppose Putnam's ideas on social capital, symbolic power, trust, and associations. Trust, as a threat to symbolic capital and comparable to social capital in Bourdieu's study, is not explicitly discussed (Siisiainen 2000). Like Putnam, Bourdieu measures social capital based on connections and their effective utilization but emphasizes that

Bourdieu emphasizes that creating, maintaining, and improving social capital directly impacts all other forms of capital that exist (Siisiainen, 2000). His perspective provides a more comprehensive understanding of social capital by incorporating the dynamics of power, resources, and cultural institutions. However, Bourdieu's study does not explicitly delve into the role of trust and its effects on social capital, unlike Putnam's focus on bridging and bonding networks and their varying degrees of trust (Crow 2002).

In his study, Fukuyama (1995) does not present arguments against Bourdieu or Putnam but rather underscores the significance of connections, trust, and societal norms as highlighted by Putnam. Fukuyama asserts that any human endeavor can succeed when there is a sufficient amount of social capital present (Siisiainen, 2000). He further examines how trust and social norms impact various aspects of society, including economic stability, development, and political dynamics. Putnam's concept of "bridging" and "bonding" networks, constituting different degrees of trust (Crow 2002), helps explore the quality of trust in Fukuyama's analysis.

Income inequality has a direct effect on individual and class life and is a foundation to poverty, “...poverty is linked to depletion in social capital’ (Cattell, 2001). Threats are posed to life expectancy and general quality of life. Differences in income causes threat to trust causing “disinvestments in social capital” (Cattell, 2001). Putnam view on connections is directly affected by income inequality as few connections exist between members with different income bands. It is to be noted that connections are based on trust especially looking at the quality, a view of Fukuyama not just quantity of connections (Cattel, 2001) (Siisiainen 2000). 

Cattel (2001) highlights a connection between fairness, trust and poverty by setting poverty as a variable. The study further aimed at racial differences between blacks and whites and puts into picture that trust can invoke ‘helpfulness’. Helpfulness is to be considered an association of will, which according to Bourdieu can create a field which people feel natural to help those that are close to them financially and can assist them in return (Vitak et el., 2011).

Income inequality directly impacts individual and societal well-being, serving as a basis for poverty and social capital depletion. Cattell (2001) asserts that poverty is intricately tied to a decline in social capital, leading to a decrease in life expectancy and overall quality of life. Moreover, income disparities erode trust, resulting in diminished "investments in social capital" (Cattell, 2001). Putnam's perspective on connections is profoundly influenced by income inequality, as there are limited links between individuals from different income brackets. It is crucial to emphasize that these connections are based on trust, focusing not only on their quantity but also on their quality, in line with Fukuyama's viewpoint (Cattell, 2001; Siisiainen, 2000).

Cattell (2001) highlights the interplay between fairness, trust, and poverty, considering poverty as a variable.

It is crucial to emphasize that these connections are based on trust, focusing not only on their quantity but also on their quality, in line with Fukuyama's viewpoint (Cattell, 2001; Siisiainen, 2000).

Cattell (2001) highlights the interplay between fairness, trust, and poverty, considering poverty as a variable. The study further examines racial disparities between blacks and whites, illustrating that trust can foster "helpfulness." Helpfulness can be viewed as an act of goodwill, in line with Bourdieu's notion of creating a social field where individuals feel inclined to assist those in close financial proximity, with the expectation of reciprocal support (Vitak et al., 2011)."

I apologize for any confusion caused, and I hope this clears up any misunderstanding.

correct this text for me chat, dont alter or remove refferences where they fit. Additionally i want you to correct punctuation and gramma before you combine that paragraph into a single paragrapgh thats condensed with same meaning "Online algorithms suggest friendships based on likes, similarities, geolocation, profession and post engagements (Vitak et el., 2011). It is arguable that high income groups would reside in high income residential areas and also engage in expensive taste even on social media. This invites Bourdieu perspective of field where social capital becomes symbolic to certain groups, societies and religions and totally mean nothing or less to the other (Siisiainen, 2000). 

Algorithms set to systematically connect certain and specific individuals failing to cross suggest low income and high income pose a threat to social capital growth. Trust remains restricted within groups and not transferable to other groups hence exclusion of certain groups in activities and the society at large. Little to no trust between certain groups brings about corruption, unbalanced/ segregated employment opportunities. A decline in trust between classes means a decline in cross networking and shared norms. (Siisiainen, 2000).  "

Online algorithms suggest friendships based on likes, similarities, geolocation, profession, and post engagements (Vitak et al., 2011). It is arguable that high-income groups would reside in affluent residential areas and exhibit expensive tastes, even on social media. This aligns with Bourdieu's perspective on the concept of a social field, where social capital holds symbolic value for certain groups, societies, and religions while meaning little or less to others (Siisiainen, 2000).

The systematic algorithms that connect individuals often fail to bridge the gap between low-income and high-income groups, indicating a threat to the growth of social capital. Trust remains confined within specific groups and is not easily transferable to others, resulting in the exclusion of certain groups from activities and society as a whole. The lack of trust between different groups contributes to corruption and imbalanced, segregated employment opportunities. A decline in trust across social classes leads to a decrease in cross-networking and the sharing of norms (Siisiainen, 2000).

Combined and condensed paragraph:
Online algorithms suggest friendships based on various factors such as likes, similarities, geolocation, profession, and post engagements (Vitak et al., 2011). High-income individuals are likely to reside in affluent areas and demonstrate expensive tastes, even on social media, reflecting Bourdieu's concept of social capital being symbolic for certain groups (Siisiainen, 2000). However, these algorithms often fail to bridge the gap between low-income and high-income groups, posing a threat to social capital growth. Limited trust between different groups results in exclusion, corruption, imbalanced employment, and a decline in cross-networking (Siisiainen, 2000).

ill provide few paragraphs for your editing, condense them and reserve meaning. keep refferences as well correct grammar spelling and logical flow. "A positive and healthy social capital can positively impact individual personal well-being. Amongst personal interests fulfilled by social capital is emotional and health support (Guo and Chen, 2002). In his study, Akta (2021) mentions two effects to social capital to be “social cultural bias” and “algorithm fallout” which still results in poverty, stress, anxiety, distrust and character vulnerability on individuals if not classes. Some individuals are said to accumulate self-hate, blame and extremes get to be suicidal cases. Noble in Akta(2021) call this ‘algorithm of oppression ‘.  

Understanding that social media is a business brings more clarity to the issue. Social media gets revenue from advertisements, and this is their priority. E-commerce has grown and these algorithms are to their benefit rather than the general society at large (Li et el., 2000). Algorithmic product and service suggestions to individuals based on their connections and interactions can create social exclusion to other people (Mohseni et el, 2018).  

‘News feed algorithms could be abused’ (Mohseni et el, 2018), algorithms created by people for people including social media algorithms are not fail proof from a bias test. Bias could emanate from training data, processing, capturing and storage systems. Each mentioned stage is prone to bias, posing opportunity distribution problems.  An algorithm can easily compare historical information and hence suggest an action. Machine learning algorithms process user data in real time and in vast numbers to deliver personalized information. Personalization of information and friend suggestions brings unfairness and discrimination amongst social classes (Vitak et el., 2011). 

It is identified that algorithms lack fairness, accountability and transparency. Facebook career advances favor minority groups whereas LinkedIn algorithms create inequality in employment opportunities. A good example is the like of Facebook favoring man for science technology and engineering jobs to a broader extent (Akta et el., 2021). On a different case black consumers were segregated by the health algorithm from accessing supplies (Akta et el., 2021). The recommendation system of information technology and AI on jobs uses collaborative filtering methods that are mainly based on LinkedIn skills endorsement (Mesa et al., 2020). Akta (2021) clearly elaborates how social capital is affected by unjust and unfair treatment, racial discrimination, income differences, sexual orientation, religion, gender which can all be adopted by AI in its training and or execution depending on the programmers' beliefs and values.  

Recent news has reported that Elon Musk, after buying twitter started rolling out the blue badge campaign where anyone who could afford $8 a month could be verified despite their actual social status. Blue badge recognition on tweeter previously meant you are a celebrity, or you are an impactful person and professional within your niche and that was strictly verified (Conger, 2023). Elon removed blue verification making everyone equal and injecting a bias to the social media community. False information around social media is a growing concern and the removal of verification meant a direct attack to trust on social media. 

 

In November an imposter account with a check mark pretended to be pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and tweeted that it could provide free insulin (Conger, 2023). This disturbance in trust doesn’t only affect the source but as well the algorithms underpinning social media as they are responsible for sharing this fake news across the globe and at times targets certain people. In a case elders had to accumulate credit stress after an algorithm did an analysis on citizens credit but used 0 for non-working days which wasn’t the case. In most times the emotional and mental disturbance caused by these can accelerate the fall of social capital exponentially. Monetization of forms of verification and premium service subscriptions introduces a disturbance to social capital of individuals across the globe.  "

Akta's study (2021) highlights two effects of social capital, namely "social cultural bias" and "algorithm fallout," which can result in poverty, stress, anxiety, distrust, and personal vulnerability. Extreme cases may lead to self-hate and suicidal tendencies, which Akta (2021) terms as the 'algorithm of oppression.'

Recognizing social media as a business clarifies the underlying issue. Social media platforms generate revenue through advertisements, prioritizing their own interests. E-commerce has thrived, and algorithms serve their benefit rather than the broader society (Li et al., 2000). Algorithmic suggestions of products and services based on personal connections and interactions can create social exclusion for other individuals (Mohseni et al., 2018).

Mohseni et al. (2018) point out that "news feed algorithms could be abused." Algorithms, including social media algorithms, are not immune to biases introduced by humans. Bias can arise from training data, processing, capturing, and storage systems, leading to problems in the distribution of opportunities. Historical information allows algorithms to make recommendations and machine learning algorithms process vast amounts of user data in real-time, resulting in personalized information. However, personalization and friend suggestions can lead to unfairness and discrimination among social classes (Vitak et al., 2011).

The lack of fairness, accountability, and transparency is evident in algorithms. Facebook's career advancements favor minority groups, while LinkedIn algorithms contribute to inequality in employment opportunities. For instance, Facebook's likes tend to favor men in science, technology, and engineering fields to a greater extent (Akta et al., 2021). Health algorithms have also segregated black consumers from accessing necessary supplies (Akta et al., 2021). The recommendation systems in information technology and AI rely on collaborative filtering methods primarily based on LinkedIn skills endorsement (Mesa et al., 2020). Akta (2021) elaborates on how social capital is affected by unjust treatment, racial discrimination, income disparities, sexual orientation, religion, and gender, all of which can be adopted by AI depending on the programmers' beliefs and values.

Recent news reported that Elon Musk, upon acquiring Twitter, initiated a campaign to offer blue verification badges for a monthly fee of $8, regardless of one's actual social status. Previously, the blue badge on Twitter indicated celebrity status or recognition as an impactful professional within a specific niche, strictly verified (Conger, 2023). Elon's decision to remove the blue verification badges introduced bias and equality issues within the social media community. The spread of false information on social media poses a growing concern, and the removal of verification directly undermines trust in social media.

In November, an imposter account with a verified badge impersonated pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and falsely claimed to provide free insulin, disrupting trust in the source and the algorithms responsible for sharing this misinformation globally. Algorithms may also inaccurately analyze individuals' credit, leading to credit stress when non-working days are erroneously calculated as 0. These instances of emotional and mental disturbance can significantly undermine social capital. The monetization of verification and premium subscriptions further disrupts social capital for individuals worldwide.

"Analysis of social media algorithms and social income impacts to social capital highlights an interdependency. Your income level can directly or indirectly restrict full access and better use of algorithms. Generally speaking, paid and premium services seem to be better at predicting and suggesting as compared to free services (LinkedIn, 2023). Similar to ChatGPT, social media paid services are quality services whereas the free services remain slow with low class algorithm interaction and filtering (OpenAI  2023). Policies that restrict algorithm bias based on income level should be put in place. Policies are also needed to ensure that certain individuals or classes that exist in the high-income band are restricted leverage to alter or have an unfair advantage on social media. "

Premium and paid services highlight a line between groups of individuals who can and cannot afford certain goods and services. From an income inequality point of view, the low class and middle might not be able to afford to subscribe to the service and as well maintain that subscription. This is an immediate and effective way to segregate a group of people due to their low-income bond. LinkedIn premium is a great example where effects of income inequality reflect themselves. Members with paid LinkedIn profiles can access more educational resources and certificate courses which improves their social capital according to Bourdieu (Siisiainen, 2000). Premium members are also seen getting more friend suggestions and can explore the network better choosing who they can interact with productively with the help of algorithms. "

'Freemium' memberships, as identified by Vock (2013), are associated with low income, limited services, and restricted access to educational and advancement opportunities. This creates a clear divide between individuals who can afford premium services and those who cannot.

Bourdieu defines economic, cultural, and social capital as closely related to class and symbolic capital. Power serves as an underlying structure in Bourdieu's analysis (Siisiainen, 2000). Bourdieu's study does not directly oppose Putnam's ideas on social capital, symbolic power, trust, and associations. Trust, as a threat to symbolic capital and comparable to social capital in Bourdieu's study, is not explicitly discussed (Siisiainen, 2000). Like Putnam, Bourdieu measures social capital based on connections and their effective utilization but emphasizes creating, maintaining and improving social capital directly impacts all other forms of capital that exist (Siisiainen, 2000). His perspective provides a more comprehensive understanding of social capital by incorporating the dynamics of power, resources, and cultural institutions.

Introduction 

Social capital, which encompasses social connections, trust, and norms within a community or society (Siisiainen, 2000), is a valuable form of symbolic power. It plays a crucial role in influencing individuals and communities by shaping their access to resources, opportunities, and support networks (Heath et al., 2018). However, income inequality and social media algorithms can have a significant impact on social capital, necessitating attention. 

According to Bourdieu, symbolic capital refers to “a reputation for competence and an image of respectability and honorability” (Heath et al., 2018). Symbolic capital exists only in the perception of others and is categorized by Bourdieu as ‘fields’ within social classes (Siisiainen, 2000). Fields represent systems of relations that are independent of the populations defined by those relations. Any form of capital can be transformed into social capital, but it is essential to recognize that fields play a major role in distributing social capital among and between classes (Hilgas et al., 2014). 

“...emergence of a type of capital (for example, in the religious field it is religious capital, i.e., a specific form of accumulated symbolic capital), whose main holders constitute the elites of the field …. All specific capital in a field, whether religious, artistic, political or scientific, is in reality a capital of recognition.” (Hilgas et el., 2014)   

Social media algorithms shape social capital by prioritizing content that aligns with users' beliefs and preferences, influencing user engagement (Vitak et al., 2011). Implementing policies to reduce economic unfairness and promote equal opportunities in social media and income distribution is crucial for enhancing social capital. Enforcing algorithmic transparency fosters responsibility and trust among social agents (Mohseni et al., 2018). 

This essay outlines the relationships and impacts of income inequality and social media algorithms on social capital, drawing insights from Putnam, Bourdieu, and Fukuyama (Siisiainen, 2000). It examines how income inequality contributes to social class formation and explores the influence of social media usage and algorithms on social capital.

The one you know has a comparable income with the lender would have higher chances to receive the loan than the one with less, thus more trust rendered to one in favor due to their income. Individuals with low income will tend to feel excluded and or feel inferior to get involved with those that have high income. Crow (2002) acknowledges that with distrust comes suspicion and doubt as well those not trusted tend to have their views, suggestions and positions in society rejected. "

Trusting someone within your own socio-economic status is easier. For instance, lending money to someone in need is more likely if they have a similar income level, creating a higher level of trust. Individuals with lower income may feel excluded and inferior when interacting with those who have higher income. This lack of trust can lead to suspicion, doubt, and rejection of their views and positions in society (Crow, 2002).

Social capital, defined as social connections, trust, and norms within a community or society (Siisiainen, 2000), serves as the focal point of this essay. The theories of social capital proposed by Putnam, Bourdieu, and Fukuyama will be examined, followed by an exploration of their perspectives on the influence of income inequality on social capital. Additionally, the analysis will shed light on the effects of social media algorithms on social media platforms.

Social capital, encompassing social connections, trust, and norms within a community or society (Siisiainen, 2000), holds significant symbolic power. It plays a vital role in shaping individuals and communities, influencing their access to resources, opportunities, and support networks (Heath et al., 2018). However, the impact of income inequality and social media algorithms on social capital cannot be overlooked, demanding our attention.

this is a backgrpound on Putnam" 
In Putnam’s social capital, networks are vital but purpose of interaction is not. Putnam based his study to the links between individuals and groups. Putnam highlighted that close connections are effective in invoking participation in a community (Boix, 1996). In ‘Making Democracy work’, Robert Putnam in (Boix, 1996) show that a society with dominant weak ties has high chances of being flooded by corruption and dysfunctional government systems. Well established social capital promotes quality and strong connections between citizens, trust, and reasonable social norms. Putnam in (Boix, 1996) measures social capital by a count of the number of social and cultural activities, communication, effective networking, advocacy and general community development. Putnum further explains associations and groups them into Vertical and horizontal associations. The mentioned associations create a different distribution and balance of power affecting decision making in (Boix, 1996). 
While all networks are important for social capital, voluntary relations hold the most significance, according to Putnam (Siisiainen, 2000). Voluntary relations enforce trust and create a society without hierarchies. However, Siisiainen (2000) believes that focusing solely on associations related to sports, leisure, and culture is inadequate. Healthy social circles characterized by trust and community accountability contribute to successful governance, as stated by Putnam (Siisiainen, 2000). Putnam's work, however, lacks discussions on politics, conflicting groups, networks, and their direct impact on social capital. Distrust and its effects on social capital are not explicitly addressed by Putnam (Siisiainen, 2000). 
Trust, shared norms, and networks between individuals are the fundamental foundations of social capital, as measured by Putnam (Siisiainen, 2000). Putnam argues that social capital is shaped by historical identities that perpetuate community segregation. Connections, especially voluntary and willing engagements, contribute to social capital and establish a healthy and functional economic system. Additionally, shared norms create a society that promotes accountability, thus reducing crime and corruption and enhancing trust within the community (Siisiainen, 2000).

In Putnam's analysis of social capital, the emphasis lies on the significance of networks rather than the specific purpose of interaction (Boix, 1996). Putnam's study focuses on the connections among individuals and groups, highlighting the effectiveness of close ties in fostering community participation (Boix, 1996). In his work "Making Democracy Work," Putnam demonstrates that societies dominated by weak ties are more susceptible to corruption and dysfunctional government systems (Boix, 1996). Established social capital facilitates strong and meaningful connections between citizens, promoting trust and fostering reasonable social norms. Putnam measures social capital by considering various factors such as the number of social and cultural activities, effective networking, communication, advocacy, and overall community development (Boix, 1996). Furthermore, Putnam categorizes associations into vertical and horizontal types, which influence the distribution and balance of power and consequently affect decision-making processes (Boix, 1996).

While all networks are deemed important for social capital, voluntary relations hold particular significance according to Putnam (Siisiainen, 2000). Voluntary relations strengthen trust and contribute to a society without hierarchical divisions. However, Siisiainen (2000) argues that focusing solely on associations related to sports, leisure, and culture is inadequate. Putnam asserts that healthy social circles characterized by trust and community accountability are essential for effective governance (Siisiainen, 2000). However, Putnam's work lacks in-depth discussions on politics, conflicting groups, networks, and their direct impact on social capital. The issue of distrust and its effects on social capital are not explicitly addressed by Putnam (Siisiainen, 2000).

According to Putnam (Siisiainen, 2000), the fundamental pillars of social capital are trust, shared norms, and networks among individuals. Putnam argues that social capitalis influenced by historical identities that perpetuate community segregation. Connections, particularly voluntary and willing engagements, contribute to social capital and establish a healthy and functional economic system. Additionally, shared norms create a society that fosters accountability, leading to a reduction in crime and corruption and enhancing trust within the community (Siisiainen, 2000)

edit without changing the meaning "Bourdieu's concept of symbolic capital, distributed among social classes through fields, plays a crucial role in social capital distribution (Hilgas et al., 2014). Social media algorithms shape social capital by prioritizing user-aligned content, emphasizing the need for policies that promote fairness and equal opportunities (Vitak et al., 2011; Mohseni et al., 2018). 
Bourdieu's study expands on Putnam's work on social capital, complementing it by incorporating the concepts of fields, habitus, social structure, and the distribution of power and resources (Siisiainen, 2000). Bourdieu highlights the close relationship between economic, cultural, and social capital, emphasizing their connection to class and symbolic capital. While both studies consider social capital based on connections and effective utilization, Bourdieu's perspective encompasses a more comprehensive understanding by integrating power dynamics and cultural institutions. However, unlike Putnam, Bourdieu's study does not explicitly address trust and its impact on social capital (Siisiainen, 2000; Crow 2002; Guo and Chen 2022).
In his study, Fukuyama (1995) does not present arguments against Bourdieu or Putnam but rather underscores the significance of social capital to the economy, connections, trust, and societal norms similar to highlighted by Putnam. Fukuyama asserts that any human endeavor can succeed when there is a sufficient amount of social capital present (Siisiainen, 2000). He further examines how trust and social norms impact various aspects of society, including economic stability, development, and political dynamics. Putnam's concept of ‘bridging’ and ‘bonding’ networks, constituting different degrees of trust helps explore the quality of trust (Fukuyama in [Crow, 2002]).
According to Fukuyama (1995), trust between social agents significantly reduces transactional costs and fosters the development of policies. The most valuable form of network consists of connections between strangers, which is often hindered by family relationships, cultural factors, and different fields. Fukuyama stresses that establishing trust with strangers comes at the expense of trust in other areas (Fukuyama,1995). In Francis's study on peasant villagers in Italy, Edward Banfield explains that family ties alone are insufficient for tangible and viable social progress. This aligns with Putnam's perspective that bridging networks and social capital are more beneficial for economic and social development compared to bonding networks and capitals (Fukuyama,1995; Guo and Chen 2022).
Perspectives of Putnam, Bourdieu, and Fukuyama shed light on the importance of social capital, trust, fields, and connections in different contexts. While Putnam focuses on voluntary relations, shared norms, and accountability, Bourdieu delves into the broader structures of power and symbolic capital (Siisiainen, 2000). Fukuyama emphasizes the significance of trust, societal norms, and their impact on economic stability and political dynamics Fukuyama (1995).

here is another text chat, edit it in a similar way to the previous. "Income inequality create classes of rich and poor. Difference in class can invoke unwillingness to connect and trust, bringing about polarization within a community (Boix and Posner, 1996 ). Gender, race, ethnicity, and educational background are factors that directly impact employment (Redmiles, 2018), which is a major source of income. Inequality is defined as the unfair difference in wealth, status, or opportunities among different groups of people (Oxford, 2023).  Differences involved manifest as income inequality, the unjust distribution of income between individuals or groups. Income inequality can be measured using various methods, such as the ‘Robinhood Index’, which considers household incomes. The degree of income inequality is closely tied to class division, resulting in the formation of upper, middle, and lower classes. Income inequality gives rise to poverty, which in turn affects mortality rates (Cattell, 2001). While Kawachi et al. in Cattell (2001) argue that differences in social opinion and stance dilute trust between hierarchical income groups, Cattell (2001) contends that inequality erodes trust. 
Income inequality directly impacts individual and societal well-being, serving as a basis for poverty and social capital depletion. Cattell (2001) asserts that poverty is intricately tied to a decline in social capital, leading to a decrease in life expectancy and overall quality of life. Moreover, income disparities erode trust, resulting in diminished "investments in social capital" (Cattell, 2001). Putnam's perspective on connections is profoundly influenced by income inequality, as there are limited links between individuals from different income brackets. It is crucial to emphasize that these connections are based on trust, focusing not only on their quantity but also on their quality, in line with Fukuyama's viewpoint (Cattell, 2001) Income inequality and social media algorithms significantly impact social capital and necessitating attention (Siisiainen, 2000).
Cattell (2001) highlights the interplay between fairness, trust, and poverty, considering poverty as a variable. The study further examines racial disparities between blacks and whites, illustrating that trust can foster "helpfulness." Helpfulness can be viewed as an act of goodwill, in line with Bourdieu's notion of creating a social field where individuals feel inclined to assist those in close financial proximity, with the expectation of reciprocal support (Vitak et al., 2011). 
Inequality in income of individuals and or groups generally creates social differences between communities (Crow, 2002). Communities with low incomes are seen neglecting their health as well not investing in there and offspring education (Cattell,  2001). Contrast to Fukuyama’s view, a poor society grows a reduced or dilapidated cultural resources which directly relates to declining social capital. Networks in Putnam's theory of social capital are highly affected by income. Groups within societies tend to connect more and freely with people that live within their income band. “Diminishing trust is the fastest way to drain a well of social capital” (Siisiainen, 2000). 
Trusting someone within your own socio-economic status is easier. For instance, lending money to someone in need is more likely if they have a similar income level, creating a higher level of trust.

'Freemium' memberships, as identified by Vock (2013), are associated with low income, limited services, and restricted access to educational and advancement opportunities. This creates a clear divide between individuals who can afford premium services and those who cannot. From the perspective of income inequality, the lower and middle classes may be unable to subscribe to such services or sustain the subscription, leading to the segregation of individuals based on their lower income status. LinkedIn premium serves as an example where income inequality manifests. Paid LinkedIn members enjoy access to more educational resources, certificate courses, and enhanced social capital, in line with Bourdieu's concept (Siisiainen, 2000). Premium members also receive more friend suggestions and can effectively navigate the network with algorithmic assistance.

Apologies for the oversight. Here's the revised sentence:

'Freemium' memberships, as identified by Vock (2013), are associated with low income, limited services, and restricted access to educational and advancement opportunities. This creates a clear divide between individuals who can afford premium services and those who cannot, further exacerbating income inequality and its impact on social capital (Siisiainen, 2000).

Social capital can be categorized as online or offline. Online social capital is built through effective interactions and presence on platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn, which have global usage (Cattell, 2001). The study of social media algorithms is crucial, as these algorithms personalize information and create echo chambers and filter bubbles (Vitak et al., 2011). The use of social media algorithms directly impacts social capital by influencing fields, networks, and trust the foundations of social capital according to Fukuyama, Putnam, and Bourdieu (Yi Mou and Carolyne A Lin, 2017). Online maintained social capital, exemplified by connections among trainees, educators, and students (Yi Mou and Caroline A Lin, 2017), holds significant importance as it directly affects other forms of capital. 
Online algorithms suggest friendships based on various factors such as likes, similarities, geolocation, profession, and post engagements (Vitak et al., 2011). High-income individuals are likely to reside in affluent areas and demonstrate expensive tastes, even on social media, reflecting Bourdieu's concept of social capital being symbolic for certain groups (Siisiainen, 2000). However, these algorithms often fail to bridge the gap between low-income and high-income groups, posing a threat to social capital growth. Limited trust between different groups results in exclusion, corruption, imbalanced employment, and a decline in cross-networking (Siisiainen, 2000).
Amongst the top 6 most used hash tags on twitter exists #jobs #education (Zinoviev et el., 2023). This indicates that many people go to tweeter in need of jobs, looking for information with regards to education and related. Education is a measure of social capital as set out in by Bourdieu’s studies (Siisiainen, 2000).
The algorithm's ability to personalize information has both limited benefits and detrimental effects on social capital. It generates echo chambers and filter bubbles, directly impacting social capital (Mohseni and Regan, 2018). Furthermore, algorithm usage and predictive suggestions contribute to societal division, limited information access, and uneven resource distribution, intensifying class exclusions (Mohseni and Regan, 2018).

"A positive social capital significantly impacts individual well-being, including emotional and health support (Guo and Chen, 2002). Akta's study (2021) highlights the effects of "social cultural bias" and "algorithm fallout" on social capital, leading to poverty, stress, anxiety, distrust, and vulnerability (Schams el el, 2018 ).
Trust is the base of any functional social media site. Functionality of a social media site is therefore disturbed by the unfairness that emanates from social media algorithms (Bernier and Ganley  2009).  Social media algorithms, driven by the revenue from advertisements, can create social exclusion by suggesting connections based on personal interactions (Li et al., 2000; Mohseni and Regan, 2018). Biases in training data and processing stages of these algorithms pose challenges, as they can be abused and affect the fairness, accountability, and transparency of the system (Mohseni and Regan, 2018).
In terms of employment opportunities, algorithms exhibit biases that favor certain groups, contributing to inequalities (Akta et al., 2021). Elon Musk's decision to remove blue verification badges on Twitter introduced bias and undermined trust in social media (Conger, 2023). Spread of false information through algorithms further disrupts trust and social capital.
Overall, the monetization of verification and premium service subscriptions also introduces disturbances to the social capital of individuals worldwide. These issues highlight the need for fairness, accountability, transparency, and careful consideration of biases in algorithmic systems, as they play a significant role in shaping social interactions and impacting social capital."

"Creating algorithms requires a rigorous quality-check process to assess their impact on individuals. Algorithmic control directly influences the distribution of social capital, significantly impacting its dynamics (Mohseni and Regan, 2018). Blindly trusting algorithms and AI systems poses a notable problem, highlighting the need for scrutiny to identify and address biases, ultimately enhancing transparency between programmers and users (Vitak et al., 2011). Providing accessible tuning filters for suggestive and predictive algorithms allows users to engage with diverse social classes, promoting user agency and interaction (Vitak et al., 2011)."

Analysis of social media algorithms and social income impacts to social capital highlights an interdependency. Your income level can directly or indirectly restrict full access and better use of algorithms. Generally speaking, paid and premium services seem to be better at predicting and suggesting as compared to free services (LinkedIn, 2023). Similar to ChatGPT, social media paid services are quality services whereas the free services remain slow with low class algorithm interaction and filtering (OpenAI  2023). Policies that restrict algorithm bias based on income level should be put in place. Policies are also needed to ensure that certain individuals or classes that exist in the high-income band are restricted leverage to alter or have an unfair advantage on social media.

The analysis of social media algorithms and their impact on social capital, in conjunction with social income, highlights a significant interdependency. One's income level can directly or indirectly limit full access and effective utilization of algorithms. Generally, paid and premium services tend to be more adept at predicting and suggesting content compared to free services (LinkedIn, 2023). Similarly, like ChatGPT, social media paid services are associated with higher-quality algorithms, while free services often have limited algorithmic interaction and filtering capabilities (OpenAI, 2023).

To address this issue, policies should be implemented to restrict algorithmic biases based on income level. It is also important to ensure that individuals or classes within the high-income bracket are not granted undue leverage to manipulate or gain unfair advantages on social media platforms. By implementing such policies, a more equitable and inclusive social media environment can be fostered, promoting equal opportunities and minimizing disparities arising from income-based algorithmic differences.

5)	Conclusion
In conclusion, income inequality and social media algorithms pose significant threats to social capital, as discussed by Robert Putnam, Pierre Bourdieu, and Francis Fukuyama. Income inequality creates social differences and divisions, leading to decreased trust and diminished social capital. It hinders connections between individuals of different income bands and reinforces segregation within society. Social media algorithms, designed to personalize information and maximize engagement, contribute to the formation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives and hindering the development of trust and shared norms (Navarro, 2001; Vitak et al., 2011). These algorithms can exacerbate class exclusions, limit access to resources and opportunities, and further divide society. To address these threats, it is crucial to implement policies and regulations that promote economic fairness, equal opportunities, and algorithmic transparency. By doing so, we can work towards enhancing social capital, fostering trust, and creating a more inclusive and cohesive society.

In conclusion, the impact of income inequality and social media algorithms on social capital cannot be overlooked, as highlighted by the research of Robert Putnam, Pierre Bourdieu, and Francis Fukuyama. Income inequality gives rise to social divisions and undermines trust, resulting in diminished social capital. The use of social media algorithms exacerbates this issue by creating echo chambers and filter bubbles that limit exposure to diverse perspectives and impede the development of trust and shared norms (Navarro, 2001; Vitak et al., 2011). These algorithms can further deepen class exclusions, restrict access to resources and opportunities, and contribute to societal division. To address these challenges, it is essential to implement policies and regulations that promote economic fairness, equal opportunities, and transparency in algorithmic processes. By doing so, we can work towards strengthening social capital, fostering trust, and building a more inclusive and united society.
